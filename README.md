This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles: issues with copying files and installing dependencies. The original Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) contains a mistake that prevents the image from building correctly, while the solution (`Dockerfile_solution.txt`) provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from potential problems in locating the `requirements.txt` file during the build process. The solution ensures the correct file path and order of operations.
